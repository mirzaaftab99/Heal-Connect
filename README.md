# Heal-Connect

Highly efficient, digital medical facilities are emerging as important places to drive greater efficiency, improve quality of care and give more people access than ever before. A clinic is a health care center that is very dedicated to caring for all patients, and can be run privately or managed by the community. From the time when the appointment is made till the end when the patient finally buys his medicines, there is a lot of paperwork involved. Moreover, the constant back-and-forth communication between the receptionist, doctor and sometimes the pharmacist creates unnecessary sophistication.  

To reduce this to some extent, we propose a digital interface which can be shared between the patient and the physician, with an admin overview. No phone calls are required to be made, no pen has to be used. Hence being in line with the contemporary climate change protocols and Indiaâ€™s green environment initiative to be carbon-neutral by 2070; as pledged by our Prime Minister of India during the 2021 Glasgow meetings.
